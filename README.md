# Belly Button Challenge

# Task
Build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datase, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

# Background
The provided dataset revealed that a small handful of microbial species also called Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU's) in the study
were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

# Data Engineering
  1. JavaScript with D3.js
  2. Plotly library
  3. Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
  4. Visual Studio Code

# Data Analysis
Bar and Bubble Charts were created to represent the microbial diversity in the belly button of the provided human samples.

The bar Chart display the top 10 OTUs found in an individual human sample. whereas the bubble chart displays the full range of OTU's found in an individual sample.
